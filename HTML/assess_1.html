        <h1>Olympic Games</h1>
The modern <b>Olympic Games</b> or <b>Olympics</b> are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of <i>athletes</i> from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than <i>200 nations</i> participating. The Olympic Games are normally held every <u>four years</u>, alternating between the <u>Summer</u> and <u>Winter Olympics</u> every two years in the four-year period.
Their creation was inspired by the <ins>ancient Olympic Games</ins>, held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. <mark>Baron Pierre de Coubertin</mark> founded the <ins>International Olympic Committee</ins> (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its <small>structure and authority</small>.
The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged <sub>14 to 18</sub>, the five Continental games <big>(Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific)</big>, and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also endorses the <strike>Deaflympics and the Special Olympics</strike>. The IOC has needed to adapt to a variety of <del>economic, political, and technological</del> advancements.
<tt>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games.</tt>
